// \“Super Ace\” Mode

Every Ace card starts out worth one point, just as normal. However, if a player has been dealt an Ace card and they decide to roll with a Tolerance number of ten, and then they proceed to roll a ten… not only would they gain the ten points as normal, but the Ace card would upgrade to a fourteen point card. If the player instead rolled less than ten, they would lose ten points as normal and the Ace card would retain it’s normal value of one point.


// \“Card Again\” Mode

Play as normal, except each player should be dealt an additional card after each round of rolls."

\n// Introduction and Equipment:

Tolerance is a skill and luck based multiplayer card and dice betting game. The equipment needed to play are, at a minimum, one deck of playing cards and one die. Paper and pen can be useful for tracking points, but are not required for play. A “standard” game of Tolerance is played with a ten sided die and one fifty-two card deck of playing cards per each group of players numbering less than or equal to five. (ex. 2 players = 1 deck, 5 players = 1 deck, 6 players = 2 decks, and so on...)

// Rules and Game Loop:
	
The eldest player is the first round Dealer. The Dealer position, from then on, rotates clockwise after each round. The player that is next in rotation to be Dealer, shall be the called the Starter. If using multiple decks of cards, they should be combined.\n

A blind bet amount shall be per-determined by those playing. When betting, players may Check, Call, Raise, or Fold just as in the classic game of Texas Hold’em Poker.

Each round is won by the player that ends the round with the most points. If there is a point during a round where every player except one folds, the last player standing is declared the Winner.

Cards numbered two through ten are worth an equal number of points to their number. Face cards are worth the following number of points; a Jack is worth eleven points, a Queen is worth twelve points, a King is worth thirteen points, and lastly, an Ace is worth one point. Joker cards shall not be used.

1. The cards are shuffled by the Dealer.
2. Two cards are dealt face down to each player in a clockwise order. Do not view the cards.
3. A blind bet of the per-determined amount shall be made by the Starter.
4. Each player may now view their cards privately.
5. Beginning with the Starter, complete the first round of betting.
6. Beginning with the Starter, complete the first round of rolls. 
           
During a round of rolls, each player must first decide if they wish to roll or not. Choosing not to role the die, also known as “choosing to pass”, will not effect the player’s point count. If the player chooses to roll the die, they have the potential to gain or lose points.

The first step to rolling is the player deciding their Tolerance number, which is a possible number to be rolled with the die. In a game that is using a ten sided die, the player may choose a number one through ten as their Tolerance number. The Tolerance number is equal to the number of points the rolling player will receive if they roll a number greater than or equal to said Tolerance number. If the player roles below said Tolerance number, they will lose the number of points equal to said Tolerance number. 

For example, a player may choose to roll and choose five as their Tolerance number. If the player rolls a six. The player would then add five points to their hand’s total. If the player instead rolled a three, they would subtract five points from their hand’s total. Lastly, if the player chose ten as their Tolerance and then rolled a ten, they would add ten points to their hand’s total. 
           
7. Beginning with the Starter, complete the second round of betting.
8. Beginning with the Starter, complete the second round of rolls.
9. Beginning with the Starter, complete the third and final round of betting.
10. Every player that has not yet folded must now show their hand publicly.
11. The Dealer should tally up each player’s points and declare the round’s Winner.
12. The Winner receives the total amount of money previously bet by the players of the round.
           
Repeat the game loop until the game is over. The game can be played similarly to Texas Hold ‘Em Poker styles of play. For example, a Tournament style is where player’s enter the game with equal sums of money and play until only one player has money, automatically declaring them the Winner. Tolerance could also be played as a No-Limit Cash Game where players can join or leave the game between rounds as they please with any amount of money they wish to play with. There are many other styles of play that work with Tolerance."
